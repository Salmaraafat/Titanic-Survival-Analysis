# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis

![Titanic Analysis](https://github.com/Salmaraafat/Titanic-Survival-Analysis/raw/main/Visualization/Titanic%20Analysis.png)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset (from Kaggle) to explore the factors that affected passenger survival.  
The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, feature engineering, and visualization to extract meaningful insights.

A simple predictive model (Logistic Regression) is also implemented to demonstrate survival prediction.
---
## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore the Titanic dataset and understand passenger demographics.
- Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, drop irrelevant columns).
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover survival patterns.
- Conduct **statistical tests** to validate relationships (e.g., Gender ↔ Survival).
- Create new **engineered features** (family size, age groups, travel status).
- Summarize **key findings** with clear, business-friendly insights.
- Build a **basic predictive model** to estimate survival outcomes.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Dataset: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster ([Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic))
---
## 🔍 Key Analysis & Insights

- **Gender**: Females had a survival rate of ~74%, compared to ~19% for males.  
- **Passenger Class**: 1st class passengers had much higher survival rates compared to 3rd class.  
- **Age**: Children had better survival chances than adults.  
- **Family Size**: Passengers traveling with family were more likely to survive than those alone.

## 📊 Features

- Cleaned and prepared Titanic dataset for analysis.
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to find key patterns in survival.
- Visualizations include:
  - Passenger class vs survival
  - Gender vs survival
  - Age distribution vs survival
  - Correlation heatmap of key variables

## ✅ Conclusions

Women and children first: Gender and age were crucial in survival chances.

Wealth mattered: 1st class passengers had priority access to lifeboats.

Traveling with family helped: Family presence increased survival rates.

These findings align with historical accounts of the Titanic disaster.
