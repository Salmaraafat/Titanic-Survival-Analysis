Project: Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Tool: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Overview:

Performed exploratory data analysis on the
 Titanic dataset to identify key factors influencing passenger survival rates.


Key Steps:

- Cleaned and handled missing data.
- Encoded categorical variables.
- Analyzed survival by gender, class, and age.
- Visualized results using bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps.


Key Findings:

- Females had a higher survival rate than males.
- Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive.
- Younger passengers had better survival chances.
